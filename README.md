Data Collection:
The data was obtained using an optic fiber photometry data acquisition system. The study involved mice that underwent brain implant surgery, and the collected data comprises wavelength intensity signals from dLight expressing neurons in the Nucleus accumbens of the Basal Ganglia.

Ethics and Validation:
The experimental protocol underwent validation by the Ethics Committee before implementation.

Data Analysis:
The MATLAB code utilized for data analysis was developed by a team consisting of:
- Julien Catanese (myself)
- Sebastien Delcasso (from AquiNeuro)

Code Availability:
Please note that as this project has not been published yet, 
the code remains unavailable to the public. 

However, a few figures have been included to illustrate the ongoing work.

This repository serves as an exemplar of the ongoing analysis, showcasing the project's progress.
