# Matlab_Dopa_Behavior_Classification

I collected Data for this project at NutriNeuro lab a Neuroscience laboratory form INARE (Bordeaux, France) 
in the team of research scientist lead by Pierre Trifilieff
I used the optic fiber photometry data aquisition system 
Subject of the study: Mice on which I did perform brain implant sugery
Data of the study: Wavelenght intensity signal fromn dLight expressing neurons in the Nucleus accumbens of the Basal Ganglia. 
Protocol was validated by Ethic comity. 

Data analysis was performed using MATLAB codes written by a team composed of : 
 - Julien Catanese (me) 
 - Sebastien Delcasso (from AquiNeuro)


The project has not been published yet so the code is still not publicly available 
However I put some figures to exemplify the work in progress.
